If 2 developers start working on same branch at a time and developer1 commited
his code after making changes and pushed to github, developer 2 also made
changes and trying to commit and push,there will be a conflict.

So, developer2 has to pull the changes first, then resolve conflicts in the files.
Then can commit and push.
